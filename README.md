## Installation

### Download

Download the latest `Focus.dmg` from the [Releases](https://github.com/anaygoyal/Focus/releases) page, then:

2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag the **Focus** app to your **Applications** folder
4. Launch Focus from your Applications folder or Spotlight

> **Note:** On first launch, you may need to right-click the app and select "Open" to bypass Gatekeeper, as the app is not notarized.

### Granting Permissions

Focus needs permission to monitor running applications:

1. Go to **System Preferences** → **Privacy & Security** → **Accessibility**
2. Click the lock icon to make changes
3. Add **Focus** to the list and enable it

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. Click the **timer icon** in your menu bar to open Focus
2. Click **Settings** to open the configuration window
3. Create or edit a **Focus Mode** (e.g., "Work")
4. Add apps you want to track by clicking the **+** button
5. Set a daily time limit for each app
6. **Activate** the focus mode to start tracking

### Menu Bar

The menu bar icon shows:
- **Green dot** — Focus mode is active
- **Gray dot** — No focus mode active

Click the icon to see:
- Current focus mode status
- Time remaining for each tracked app
- Quick access to Settings

### When Time Runs Out

When you exceed your time limit for an app:
1. The app is automatically closed
2. A blocker window appears
3. If you set a password, you'll need to enter it to dismiss the blocker
4. The app remains blocked until the next day (usage resets at midnight)
